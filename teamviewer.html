      <h1>TeamViewer</h1>
      <p>TeamViewer is our primary software solution for remote support and remote work. When a client needs remote support we ask them to select remote support on their Shipstore web application. If they have difficulty finding it offer to email them a link to get connected for remote support. For version 4 the link will be in the lower right hand side of their web application. Once they click the link it will download the TeamViewer QuickSupport client. This will allow you to remote control the client's station.</p>

      <p>To get connected to a specific client to provide support we need to give them a session code or send them a link to their email linking a created session. Alternatively the client themselves can create a session and you'll see this appear in your Full Support TeamViewer client. To get a session code select the service queue on the left side of the TeamViewer interface. Click New Session, enter the name of the customer and their organization for the session name then continue. The next panel select New contacts for the group and then select yourself as the expert, this will assign the session to your TV connection. After this you'll see the created session under Sessions here you can also send off an email link on the right side of the session item.</p>

      <p>If for some reason you get disconnected or the station you are troubleshooting reboots normally you can reconnect from the session again by selecting Connect. </p>
