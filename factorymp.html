      <h1>Factory Motor Parts</h1>
      
      <p>Factory Motor Parts is a large organization based out of Eagan, Minnesota. They provide OEM auto equipment to retailers and have recently been growing into independent service centers.</p>
      <h2>Customizations</h2>
      <p>FMP has many different customizations with Shipstore for their operations. Here are some of them:</p>
      <p>We use the address book functionality for two different processes within Factory Motor Parts' environment. For third party billing
        we use the address book to load account information based on a customer ID, then we set the terms to third party billing if that ID is found. The second address book customization is for shipments to Walmart FMP has to provide a differing return address we utilize the customer ID for that to populate that return address.</p>
      <h2>SpeeDee</h2>
      <p>Factory Motor Parts locations utilizes SpeeDee for much of their shipping. We've ran into a few instances where they are disputing the rates they are being charged via SpeeDee and have gotten conflicting information from their SpeeDee representative. Whenever this happens we need to build an information portfolio of the shipments in question. Get all the shipments the FMP location is disputing and the rates they were charged by SpeeDee. Then go and rate them yourself under that profile. Make sure to gather all of the rate information in the export shipment section. Of most import will be the ListCharge and the Accessorial surcharges that SpeeDee is incurring them with. Make sure the FMP location is supplying their SpeeDee representative with the SpeeDee manifest and not the daily shippers report which is for internal use only.</p>
